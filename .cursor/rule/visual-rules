Style Rules: Modern Minimalist Black-and-White Design

Design Philosophy

The visual style must be clean, minimal, and typography-driven.

Use only shades of black, white, and gray—but avoid pure white (#FFFFFF) and pure black (#000000).

No decorative elements, gradients, shadows, or textures.

The layout and visual hierarchy should rely on spacing, alignment, and typography.

Color Palette

Use a soft white (e.g., #F7F7F7 or #FAFAFA) as the light background.

Use a soft black or dark gray (e.g., #111111, #1A1A1A, or #222222) for headings and primary text.

Use neutral grays (e.g., #888888, #B0B0B0) for secondary text or borders.

Ensure sufficient contrast for readability and accessibility without relying on high saturation.

Typography

Use a sans-serif font that reflects modern minimalism (e.g., Inter, Helvetica Neue, or Work Sans).

Apply large, bold headings with generous spacing for a calm and spacious feeling.

Body text should use light-to-regular font weights, with a consistent line-height for readability.

Maintain a clear typographic hierarchy using font size, weight, and spacing instead of color or decoration.

Layout and Spacing

Use ample white space to separate content blocks and reduce visual noise.

Apply a consistent grid or column-based layout to guide structure.

Use strict alignment rules—everything should snap to a baseline grid or visual rhythm.

No borders unless necessary; when used, they must be 1px solid in a neutral gray tone.

Elements and UI Components

No rounded corners—use sharp, squared edges on all components.

Buttons should be rectangular, flat, and unobtrusive, with no shadows or gradients.

Inputs and forms should use only lines or simple solid fills in gray tones.

Icons, if used, should follow the same visual tone (monochrome, stroke-based, minimal).

Interactivity and Feedback

Use only subtle hover effects, such as a change in text color or background tone within the grayscale palette.

Avoid animation or transitions unless they serve a functional purpose and are minimal (e.g., 0.2s opacity fade).

Error, success, or warning states should be handled using contrast and hierarchy (e.g., bold text or background contrast) without color coding.

Accessibility

Maintain WCAG-compliant contrast ratios using off-black and off-white shades.

Avoid relying on color alone to convey information. Use text labels or icons where needed.

Ensure all elements are keyboard-accessible and screen-reader-friendly.

Summary of Visual Constraints

Monochrome only: grayscale palette with no pure black or white

No rounded corners

No shadows, gradients, or decorative effects

No unnecessary borders or visual clutter

All focus on spacing, typography, and alignment
